AutoLayout Playground

In this project I currently implemented a way to have different layouts for portrait and landscape orientation based on Autolayout.
The goal was to do as much as possible in Interface Builder and to use assisting code where necessary.
The solution is quite simple actually, but maybe not obvious.
